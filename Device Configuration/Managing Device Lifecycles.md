we will be implementing a BYOD model for employees to bring any device they may want.We will be enrolling and managing both company owned and BYOD devices.

## Enrolling and managing a BYOD device
1. well sign into our test device and join it to the entra environment by going go "work or School"
2. select connect then "Join this device to microsoft Entra ID"
3. sign in with your entra account
4. on your admin machine head over to entra.microsoft.com
5. Head over to Identity> Devices and select All Devices
6. select the device that was just joined
7. Go ahead and delete the device
8. refresh the devices page until the device is gone
9. Heading back to the test machine, well select "add microsoft account"
10. sign in with your microsoft account
11. now go ahead and head over to work and school again and disconnect the machien from the Entra Environment.
12. This is the the life cycle of a device that is a byod device! (in a real world scenario, this is what would happen to a device when a user is terminated or retiring.)
