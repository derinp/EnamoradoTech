# EnamoradoTech
Demo Office 365 enterprise tenant


# Project Overview

After several years in IT, I've come to believe that specializing is the best way forward. In my experience, I've observed that a vast majority of businesses utilize Microsoft SaaS products in some capacity. This project is my journey towards specializing in administering Microsoft cloud environments.

I will be using a Microsoft tenant for experimentation, testing, and studying for my Microsoft certifications. The ultimate goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of a cloud-based Microsoft environment.

# The Tenant - Enamorado Tech

Enamorado Tech is a small business with a team of 5 employees and a few endpoints that need to be managed in Intune. I will be using GitHub for documentation and leveraging the tools provided by a 365 tenant to create solutions. These solutions aim to simplify business operations for the employees at Enamorado Tech.
